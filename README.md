  Home Assistant Configuration of Mice House

<div align="center">
  <h4>
    This is my <a href="https://home-assistant.io">Home Assistant</a> configuration which is running on Docker. When starting with home automation I found many well documented configurations and drew inspiration from them in order to achieve my automation goals. I wanted to share my success with the community and hopefully help others on their journey.
